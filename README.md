# Finite Monoids

This repo is for me to play around with finite monoids as a vehicle for learning about scala, functional programming, and group theory.
My inspiration to create this project came from the excellent book: "Functional Programming in Scala" (https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala)

## How many monoids?

- Can I generate a monoid instance directly from a cayley table?
- Can I generate all unique cayley tables of a given size?
- Can I then use this to count monoids?
- Can I tell if a monoid is a group?
- Can I use this informtion to count groups?
